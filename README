pamix: Pulseaudio Stereo Mixer
==============================

Creates a virtual microphone that mixes the physical microphone with sounds
from an application. The system sounds are merged into the virtual microphone
that can be used to record a mix of your voice and the application's audio with 
Audacity, a video messenger, et cetera.

Load the sink with 

    ./load-sinks.sh

The volumes of the two relevant sources -- the physical microphone and the
loopback interface -- should be available in Pulseaudio Volume Control
(pavucontrol) after the sinks have been loaded. To mix an application's
audio into the virtual microphone, go to the Playback tab in pavucontrol and
choose "Simultaneous output for Mix-for-Virtual-Microphone,...". You can now
listen to the application's output whilst also recording it with the virtual
microphone.

If a recording application does not immediately pick up on the new virtual
microphone, start it, then head to the "Recording" tab in pavucontrol. It
should be possible to force the recording application to listen to the virtual
microphone instead of what it defaulted to.

To unload the virtual microphone, run

    ./unload-sinks.sh

WARNING: this is NOT a professional quality mixing solution, suitable for live
music etc.  In particular, there are some problems with latency that I haven't
figured out. The purpose is to be a (very) lightweight shell script that
suffices for sharing music and game audio over live streams and chat.
